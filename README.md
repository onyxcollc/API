### Financial Analysis
Recently we have had the chance at helping Harold with the Budget Analysis and and Retirement Planning portion of Harold's firm. In this Financial report we were able to evaluate the customer's spending habits as well as retirement prospects. We were able to use the Plaid API to acces the data and evaluate all of the transactions that occured in the customer's bank account. Everything from income to what he spends his money on was examined.

By accesssing the Plaid API we were able to find last year's income before tax, the current monthly income, and the projected year's income before tax. These figures can be found in the attached files.

# Retirement Planner
In this part of the financial analysis, we created a weighted portfolio consisting of the SPY and AGG where we ran Monte Carlo simulations over 30 years long and plotted the results. We later found the 90% confidence intervals plotted them against the cumulative returns. We also used Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the returns at 10%, 50% and 90% quartiles. We also determined the difference between withdraws from the retirement account based on the amount put into the initial savings account. All of this can be found in the documents attached.
